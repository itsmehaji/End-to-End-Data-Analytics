- **dim_rooms.csv** - Room category information

### Fact Tables
- **fact_bookings.csv** - Detailed booking transactions (13+ MB)
- **fact_aggregated_bookings.csv** - Pre-aggregated booking metrics

### Supporting Files
- **meta_data_hospitality.txt** - Data dictionary and field descriptions
- **metrics list.xlsx** - Key performance indicators and calculated measures
- **mock up dashboard_atliq grands.png** - Initial dashboard design mockup
- **Helper Document - hospitality.pdf** - Project requirements and business context
